## Grow-with-Google Project #4: "Landing Page Project" from my Google-Udacity Scholarship NanoDegree Bootcamp for Front End Developers.
 
## My Netlify link for the Project #4 is:  
https://udacity-project4-landing-page-v4main.netlify.app/  

## This is a 1-page Landing Page with 5 sections: 
    * The challenges required to build this Landing Page adds to the user having a great User Experience while using this app. 
    * This project included a challenging task to dynamically create the navigation elements in the DOM instead of hardcoding the list items and anchor tags in index.html. 
    * Other challenges were to highlight the active section on the page, along with the corresponding active list item, so that the user always knows exactly which section they are reading. 
    * Also, whenever the user clicks a list item, this project required code that allowed the viewport to scroll smoothly from section to section.  

## This Front End Developer Nanodegree (FEND) Bootcamp:
This bootcamp is a coding scholarship program financed by Google to increase the number of high-level, skilled developers around the world.

### The starter code for this project:
- The starter code for this project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. 
- I am required to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. 
- That requires modifying the files to make this application interactive and dynamic.

### The technologies used for this project are:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * but the majority of added files are JavaScript.
    * the Udacity starter zip file comes with no javascript starter files.

### The functionalities required to meet this project's specifications are:  
    * Write clean, simple, modular code that is easy to read by others.
    * Write enough comments for the code to make it easy to understand the logic.
    * Highlight the Active section so the visitor knows which section they are on. 
    * Highlight the Active nav links so the visitor knows which link they are on.
    * I used 'Smooth Scroll - scrollIntoView' method to improve the User Experience.
    * Make the viewport responsive on all screen sizes ... added media queries for phone and tablet.
    * Create li and anchor links dynamically using the dom and javascript.
    * Improve the User Interface to make the Landing Page easier to navigate and to consume the content.
    * Improve the User Experience to make learning enjoyable, friendly and comfortable when learning new knowledge.

### The Research for this project included:    
    * Guidance from my weekly Session Leader - Rockwell, different Slack Leaders, and suggestions from the project reviewers    
    # The blog content for this project is taken from a blog by Kealan Parr called The Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming.
    * Google browser's Inspect Elements and Dev Page Source tools
    * YouTube walkthroughs, freeCodeCamp, etc
    * YouTube tutorials such as Kevin Powell, Brad Traversy, Cifer, etc.
